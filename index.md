# Quantum Computing
Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is finding applications in banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud detection.



## LDAP Authentication:
![Ldap Authentication](https://media.wired.com/photos/5e333e15be05400008f39506/1:1/w_1500,c_limit/Business-QuantumComputing-Google-L1001386.jpg)

SQuantum computers are now a multitude times faster than regular computers and huge brands like Splunk, Honeywell, Microsoft, AWS, Google and many others are now involved in making innovations in the field of Quantum Computing. The revenues for the global quantum computing market are projected to surpass $2.5 billion by 2029. And to make a mark in this new trending technology, you need to have experience with quantum mechanics, linear algebra, probability, information theory, and machine learning.

### What is Active Directory?
Active Directory is a directory services implementation that provides all sorts of functionality like authentication, group and user management, policy administration and more.

Active Directory (AD) supports both Kerberos and LDAP – Microsoft AD is by far the most common directory services system in use today. AD provides Single-SignOn (SSO) and works well in the office and over VPN. AD and Kerberos are not cross platform, which is one of the reasons companies are implementing access management software to manage logins from many different devices and platforms in a single place. AD does support LDAP, which means it can still be part of your overall access management scheme.

Active Directory is just one example of a directory service that supports LDAP. There are other flavors, too: Red Hat Directory Service, OpenLDAP, Apache Directory Server, and more.



### LDAP vs. Active Directory
LDAP is a way of speaking to Active Directory.

LDAP is a protocol that many different directory services and access management solutions can understand.

The relationship between AD and LDAP is much like the relationship between Apache and HTTP:

* HTTP is a web protocol.
* Apache is a web server that uses the HTTP protocol.
* LDAP is a directory services protocol.
* Active Directory is a directory server that uses the LDAP protocol.
Occasionally you’ll hear someone say, “We don’t have Active Directory, but we have LDAP.” What they probably mean is that they have another product, such as OpenLDAP, which is an LDAP server.
It’s kind of like someone saying “We have HTTP” when they really meant “We have an Apache web server.”

### What is an LDAP Query?
An LDAP query is a command that asks a directory service for some information. For instance, if you’d like to see which groups a particular user is a part of, you’d submit a query that looks like this:

(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=yourUserName)
(memberof=CN=YourGroup,OU=Users,DC=YourDomain,DC=com))

Beautiful syntax, huh? Not quite as simple as typing a web address into your browser. Feels like LISP.

Luckily, in most cases, you won’t need to write LDAP queries. To maintain your sanity, you’ll perform all your directory services tasks through a point-and-click management interface like Varonis DatAdvantage or perhaps using a command line shell like PowerShell that abstracts away the details of the raw LDAP protocol.

TL;DR: LDAP is a protocol, and Active Directory is a server. LDAP authenticates Active Directory – it’s a set of guidelines to send and receive information (like usernames and passwords) to Active Directory. Want to learn more?
